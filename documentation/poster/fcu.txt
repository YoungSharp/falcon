The central flight control unit (FCU) is responsible for communication between the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the motor control unit (MCU).
This device analyzes data from the system's sensors, and interprets them in
order to send motor speed commands to the motor controller that will put
the vehicle in the desired state.
The microcontroller on the FCU is an Atmel AVR XMega 128A3, which is a 32MHz
8-bit device with a number of integrated SPI, UART, and ADC modules.
The FCU communicates on with the MCU and IMU on a 2MHz SPI bus, and is able to
talk to chips separately using up to eight chip select pins.  UART is used
for off-board communication through a serial to USB converter, and an 802.15 XBee wireless module.
