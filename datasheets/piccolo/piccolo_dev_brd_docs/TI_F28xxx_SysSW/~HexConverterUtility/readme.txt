The C2000 HexConverter Utility is a simple wrapper GUI allowing greater simplicity when creating .a00 (hex) files.  Specifically,
the A00 files created by the program will (when sent across a serialport) allow a target F28x controller to boot from the SCI peripheral.  

This Utility utilizes the Hex2000.exe executable within the C2000 tools in CCS:
The default path for this file is:
C:\CCStudio_v3.3\C2000\cgtools\bin\hex2000.exe
